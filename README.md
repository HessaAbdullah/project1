### Installation:
In this project, I need to work with SQL" just the basics" and you need to be able to work with Excel on your computer to read the data and visulazed it.
### Summary:
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where i live to overall global temperature trends.
### Project Instructions:
1. Extract the data from the database. 
> Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
> Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
2. Open up the CSV in  Excel or Google sheets or any other tool.
3. Create a line chart.
> to compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
4. Make observations about the similarities and differences.
### Results:
- My city’s moving average is always higher than the global moving average. For example: Riyadh’s average temperature around (1994-2013) was 26.49° and the global was 9.43° which is a huge difference. 
-  The difference between Riyadh and global moving average is almost consistent where Riyadh is higher by around 10°.
-  The trend is almost shaped as a straight line that is starting to rise. It is not consistent, but it is rising very slowly over the last few hundred years.
-  The World is getting hotter in both moving averages.
